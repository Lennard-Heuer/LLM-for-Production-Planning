This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\\n\\n### Real Life Implications and Interpretation\\nBy introducing workforce stabilization strategies, the manufacturing system will see fewer disruptions caused by constant hiring and firing. This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory's workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.\"\"\""
