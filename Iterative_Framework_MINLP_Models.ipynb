This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\\n# | Inventory Limit | Limit the storage to half of the total inventory per product per period. | Reduces holding costs and ensures optimized warehouse utilization. High inventory costs were identified in the previous feedback, making this strategy necessary. |\\n# | Scale Profit | Added a non-linear profit term to simulate economies of scale. | Simulating economies of scale where increased production reduces the cost per unit, leading to higher overall profits. |\\n```'"

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, at the end of the code don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Also use Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) for objective function and constraints using scipy package which I installed already (numpy and pulp installed already too). Also use embedded interpretable functions. Whenever you modify the optimization model, include to say what the real life implications would be, how this modification would be interpreted in a real life manufacturing system. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies (and workforce strategies if such elements appear in the current LP model) based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned and such strategies exist already, still add at least one more. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX and so on ..... (don't forget to print out any decision variable that was also used in the initial optimization model code. Print it out as a python list not numpy list.) If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function, or for workforce), description strategy, and reason for this: (= which problem(s) detected in the last performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!). Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example} (collecting the stretegies in this table, not deleting the older ones). These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out only one new additionally added extension/new strategy compared to the LP model that I've shown you as the current solution. In case you see a modification and its annotation already you can do another one. Modify the optimization model and make use of non-linear stretegies!, while making sure the model is executable as it is with pulp and scipy having been installed already. THis can serve you as an example what i mean: {Schablone}. It can show you how to create an executable code\"}\n",

This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\n",

This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\n",

The inventory limit will ensure that storage costs are minimized and warehouse space is efficiently utilized. This will result in reduced holding costs and stabilization in the workforce, minimizing disruptions caused by frequent changes in the workforce. These strategies are likely to lead to more predictable and efficient production schedules, reduced labor costs, and overall improved financial performance.']"

This modification aims to address the problem of missed sales and backorder penalties noticed in the performance feedback. The approach ensures that production and storage are balanced with sales more diligently.\\n\\nBy running this code, the decision variables should print out properly as lists, and overall improvements in profit should be realized by correcting the errors identified earlier.']"

This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\\n\\n### Real Life Implications and Interpretation\\nBy introducing workforce stabilization strategies, the manufacturing system will see fewer disruptions caused by constant hiring and firing. This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory's workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.\"\"\""

This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\\n\\n### Real Life Implications and Interpretation\\nBy introducing workforce stabilization strategies, the manufacturing system will see fewer disruptions caused by constant hiring and firing. This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory\\'s workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.']\n"

This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\n",
