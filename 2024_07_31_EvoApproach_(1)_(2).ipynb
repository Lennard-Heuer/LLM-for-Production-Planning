For the decision varaibles amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology as printouts: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX, Stock: XXX. In case the LP you create includes workforce planning, also include: Workforce: XXX, Hires: XXX, Firings: XXX, Overtime: XXX\"}\n",

This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\\n\\n### Real Life Implications and Interpretation\\nBy introducing workforce stabilization strategies, the manufacturing system will see fewer disruptions caused by constant hiring and firing. This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory\\'s workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.\\n\\nThe code now ensures all variables are properly defined and used within the function. Run the code to see the improved results with the new strategy in place.'].\"\"\""

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, at the end of the code don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies (and workforce strategies if such elements appear in the current model) based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned and such strategies exist already, still add at least one more. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX and so on ..... If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function, or for workforce), description strategy, and reason for this: (= which problem(s) detected in the last performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!). Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out at least one additional extension/new strategy compared to the LP model that I've shown you as the current solution.\",\n",

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, at the end of the code don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies (and workforce strategies if such elements appear in the current model) based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned and such strategies exist already, still add at least one more. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX and so on ..... If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function, or for workforce), description strategy, and reason for this: (= which problem(s) detected in the last performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!). Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out at least one additional extension/new strategy compared to the LP model that I've shown you as the current solution.\",\n",

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, in the end, don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX, Stock: XXX. If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function): [description strategy], reason for this: [what problem detected in the performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!]. Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out only one additional extension compared to the LP model that I've shown you.\",\n",

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, in the end, don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX, Stock: XXX. If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function): [description strategy], reason for this: [what problem detected in the performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!]. Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out only one additional extension compared to the LP model that I've shown you.\",\n",
