This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\\n\\n### Real Life Implications and Interpretation\\nBy introducing workforce stabilization strategies, the manufacturing system will see fewer disruptions caused by constant hiring and firing. This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes.

The non-linear profit term promotes consistent production volumes, aligning with real-life scenarios where higher outputs with lower costs can lead to better profitability.\n",

            "By limiting the hiring and firing rates, the workforce stabilizes, reducing expenses associated with frequent personnel changes, such as hiring costs and training time. This should lead to overall smoother operations, ultimately translating to higher efficiency and better morale among workers by avoiding job insecurity. \n",

            "These alterations should help sharpen competitiveness in the market while responding to the critiques from previous performance results.\n",

This error arises from attempting to use the power operator (`**`) on a `LpVariable`, which is not supported in this context. Instead of introducing a non-linear profit term, we'll focus on linear constraints and strive to improve the optimization model while maintaining its integrability. \n",

Just-in-Time (JIT) production for product 0: This strategy aims to reduce inventory holding costs and minimize waste by producing only what is needed to meet demand.\\n2. Safety stock for product 1: This strategy ensures availability of product 1 during periods of high demand by maintaining a minimum inventory level.\\n3. Storage capacity constraint: This constraint limits storage capacity for each product to prevent overstocking and reduce storage costs.\\n\\nI also added a new decision variable `Storage` to represent the storage levels for each product and period.

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, at the end of the code don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies (and workforce strategies if such elements appear in the current model) based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned and such strategies exist already, still add at least one more. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX and so on ..... If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function, or for workforce), description strategy, and reason for this: (= which problem(s) detected in the last performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!). Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out at least one additional extension/new strategy compared to the LP model that I've shown you as the current solution.\",\n",

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, at the end of the code don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies (and workforce strategies if such elements appear in the current LP model) based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned and such strategies exist already, still add at least one more. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX and so on ..... If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function, or for workforce), description strategy, and reason for this: (= which problem(s) detected in the last performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!). Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out at least one additional extension/new strategy compared to the LP model that I've shown you as the current solution.\",\n",

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, at the end of the code don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies (and workforce strategies if such elements appear in the current model) based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned and such strategies exist already, still add at least one more. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX and so on ..... If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function, or for workforce), description strategy, and reason for this: (= which problem(s) detected in the last performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!). Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out at least one additional extension/new strategy compared to the LP model that I've shown you as the current solution.\",\n",

The objective function now includes a term for storage costs.\\n\\nNote that I assumed some additional data, such as storage cost and storage capacity, which may need to be adjusted based on the specific problem instance.',\n",

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, in the end, don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX, Stock: XXX. If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function): [description strategy], reason for this: [what problem detected in the performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!]. Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out only one additional extension compared to the LP model that I've shown you.\",\n",

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, in the end, don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX, Stock: XXX. If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function): [description strategy], reason for this: [what problem detected in the performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!].

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, in the end, don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX, Stock: XXX. If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function): [description strategy], reason for this: [what problem detected in the performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!].

Also use the same format/notation how the chunks are written differentiated from the rest of the text (```python at the beginning of the code, ``` at the end of the code). In the beginning of the code, don't forget the python in ```python, in the end, don't forget the ```!!!!. Create a solution that is similar to the existing one but not the same, therefore, alter the optimization function or add additional constraints. Don't forget to always include the input data and to run the function after defining it. This is the performance feedback of the current solution obtained by simulation: {previous_feedback}. To do this, find new storage strategies, production, and sales strategies based on the existing feedback of the current solution. Concentrate on these strategies that I just mentioned. Also do this in a refined manner: Sometimes, apply certain policies to only certain products and certain time periods. Do not alter the real life input data, but change the optimization function and/or add constraints or extend the existing constraints! Write the code in a way that when running the code, the decision variables will be outputted as (multidimensional) arrays. Also return the profit earned. Do not omit any piece of code or input data, because I immediately want to run the code you outputted just as it is. For the printout of the decision variables amount produced and sales and stock use this exact terminology: Produced: XXX, Sale: XXX, Stock: XXX. If you use packages other than pulp, also write import XXX into the code. When you write the comments like # New strategy for storage (resp. for production, for sales, for objective function): [description strategy], reason for this: [what problem detected in the performance feedback the newly added strategy is working against. Explicitly name the problem spotted in the simulation feedback!]. Add these information (description and the 'why' at last behind the code in the form of a table), the shape must be exactly like in the given example: {explain_example}. These are just examples and should show the data structure! Try out only one additional extension compared to the LP model that I've shown you.\",\n",
