This strategy aims to stabilize the workforce over the periods. |\\n\\n### Real Life Implications and Interpretation\\nBy introducing workforce stabilization strategies, the manufacturing system will see fewer disruptions caused by constant hiring and firing. This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory's workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.\"\"\""

            "# | Economies of Scale Non-linear Term | Added a non-linear profit term to simulate economies of scale where more production reduces cost per unit. | Based on the performance feedback, frequent workforce changes were leading to high costs.

            "### Real-life Implications and Interpretation:\n",
            "By introducing a non-linear term that simulates economies of scale, we will potentially reduce the overhead cost as the production scale increases. This reflects a more realistic production scenario where producing in larger batches tends to decrease the unit cost due to factors like bulk purchasing of raw materials, optimized utilization of machinery, etc. In real-life manufacturing systems, this could lead to more effective production runs and better resource utilization, ultimately increasing profitability.\n",
            "Sure, I'll correct the issue related to the unsupported operand for exponential operations with `LpVariable`. We'll instead introduce a non-linear function using `scipy.optimize` for the objective function.\n",

            "# | Economies of Scale Non-linear Term | Added a non-linear profit term to simulate economies of scale where more production reduces cost per unit. | Based on the performance feedback, frequent workforce changes were leading to high costs.

            "### Real-life Implications and Interpretation:\n",
            "By introducing a non-linear term that simulates economies of scale, we will potentially reduce the overhead cost as the production scale increases. This reflects a more realistic production scenario where producing in larger batches tends to decrease the unit cost due to factors like bulk purchasing of raw materials, optimized utilization of machinery, etc. In real-life manufacturing systems, this could lead to more effective production runs and better resource utilization, ultimately increasing profitability.\n",
            "Sure, I'll correct these issues and ensure that the solution runs successfully. We will avoid using exponentiation directly due to the limitation of `LpVariable` in `Pulp`. Instead, we'll use linear constraints and multiply coefficients where necessary to simulate the economies of scale. \n",

This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory's workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.\n",

            "By introducing workforce stabilization strategies, the manufacturing system will see fewer disruptions caused by constant hiring and firing. This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory's workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.\n",

This stabilized workforce will have smoother operations, reduced costs associated with rehiring and training, and ultimately lead to better predictability in workforce management.\n",

This approach would lead to better prediction and planning capabilities, leading to potentially smoother operations and less time-consuming workforce training and onboarding processes. In essence, the factory's workforce would become more stable and efficient, leading to a more predictable and potentially more productive environment.\n",

We will introduce one new strategy to the model, specifically incorporating non-linearity into the profit term to simulate economies of scale, and add constraints to limit hiring and firing to certain periods.\n",
